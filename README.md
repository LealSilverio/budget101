# Overview

Budget 101 is a simple Java application that helps users manage their day-to-day expenses. You can add expenses by category (like Food or Transport) and view summaries of their spending by category or date. The app keeps track by writing all expenses in a text file, so even if you close the program, your data is saved for next time. It’s built using core Java concepts like object-oriented programming (with classes for expenses), ArrayLists to store data, and file handling to save and load the expenses. It’s a practical, straightforward tool that makes personal finance tracking easy.

The purpose of this software is to learn Java and test programming in Java. It's also a test of the integration of Java with Visual Studio Code.
